      "*   **Neutral Color Palette:** Predominantly whites, creams, tans, and light browns.\n",
      "*   **Natural Materials:**  Wood, rattan/wicker, textiles with natural textures.\n",
      "*   **Relaxed and Comfortable Vibe:** The furniture placement and the use of pillows/throws create a cozy atmosphere.\n",
      "*   **Modern Simplicity:** Clean lines in the furniture but softened with organic elements.\n",
      "* **Round Accent Shapes:** Mirros, pillows, ottomans, vases.\n",

      "**Chair Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Chair 1 (Round Wooden Stool):** This chair clashes with the room. The modern design of the stool does not align with the relaxed boho theme of the room. It is also too low for general use in the living room.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Chair 2 (White Upholstered Armchair):** This chair is very appropriate for the room. The white color and the buttoned details of the chair align with the room's color palette and create a relaxed boho theme. The rounded nature of the chair would also fit well with the round accents in the room.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Chair 3 (White Wooden Stool):** This chair clashes with the room. While the color is appropriate, the geometric and sharp lines of the chair do not fit the room's relaxed boho theme. It is also too low for general use in the living room.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Chair 4 (Low Modern Upholstered Chair with Wooden Base):** This chair fits well with the room. The neutral, earthy color of the upholstery is well-suited to the room's color palette. The low profile and the wooden base with angular legs provide a touch of modern simplicity while maintaining an organic feel. The chair fits well with the neutral color palette.\n",

    "- recommending wallpaper based on the room and settings\n",

    "You may also want to explore how you can build a RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) system where you retrieve relevant images from your store inventory to users who can they use Gemini to help identify the most ideal choice from the various options provided, and also explain the rationale to users."
