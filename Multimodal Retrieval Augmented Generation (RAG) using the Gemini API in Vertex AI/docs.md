# Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Gemini API in Vertex AI

## 📖 Overview

In this lab, you’ll implement a **Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using the **Gemini API** in Vertex AI. The goal is to **enhance AI-generated responses** by incorporating relevant external documents, images, and text into the prompt to provide **more accurate and grounded outputs**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the principles of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
- Load and index **multimodal documents** (e.g., PDFs with images and text).
- Retrieve relevant content in real-time to **augment prompts**.
- Generate **context-aware responses** using **Gemini’s multimodal capabilities**.

## 🛠️ Tasks

1. **Set up Vertex AI** with the appropriate project and region settings.
2. Load the **Gemini multimodal model** (`gemini-1.0-pro-vision`).
3. Use a **vector database** or **embedding technique** to store and retrieve relevant documents.
4. Feed **retrieved multimodal context** (text and image snippets) into the Gemini model.
5. Generate **answers or summaries** using the enhanced context.

## 🧠 What is Multimodal RAG?

Multimodal RAG combines:

- **Retrieval**: Pulling the most relevant documents (text/images) related to a query.
- **Augmentation**: Adding these documents into the prompt.
- **Generation**: Producing answers that are grounded in the retrieved data.

This is useful in scenarios like document summarization, customer support, and knowledge management where **visual and textual information** need to be processed together.

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Build a **RAG system** that utilizes both text and images.
- Understand how Gemini’s **multimodal input** boosts response quality.
- Learn how to apply RAG for **business insights**, **research**, or **enterprise search**.

## ✅ Prerequisites

- Google Cloud project with Vertex AI enabled.
- Familiarity with embeddings and document retrieval.
- Sample **multimodal dataset** (e.g., PDF with product images + descriptions).
