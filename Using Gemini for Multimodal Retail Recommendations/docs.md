# Using Gemini for Multimodal Retail Recommendations

## 🛍️ Overview

In this lab, you’ll learn how to build a **multimodal retail recommendation system** using **Gemini’s vision and text capabilities** in Vertex AI. The system will take both **product images** and **customer preferences** as inputs to generate personalized product recommendations.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Set up and use **Vertex AI Gemini multimodal model**.
- Provide **image and text input** to the Gemini model.
- Generate **intelligent retail suggestions** based on multimodal input.
- Explore real-world use cases for **e-commerce personalization**.

## 🛠️ Tasks

1. Initialize **Vertex AI** with your project ID and region.
2. Load the **Gemini multimodal model** (`gemini-1.0-pro-vision`).
3. Input a **product image** (e.g., a shoe) and a **customer text query** (e.g., “I need something similar in black with better grip”).
4. Capture and display the **AI’s recommendations** based on the combined inputs.

## 📚 Learning Outcome

By the end of this lab, you will:

- Understand how to use **multimodal input** (image + text) for contextual AI recommendations.
- Learn how Gemini can **interpret customer needs** visually and textually.
- Gain practical skills to build **retail AI applications** using Vertex AI.

## ✅ Prerequisites

- Google Cloud Project with **Vertex AI API enabled**.
- Python environment with **Vertex AI SDK** installed.
- A sample dataset of **product images and metadata**.
